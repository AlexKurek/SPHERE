VLTPF
=====

**Warning**
-----------

**This module is still under development at the moment. Processing of IRDIS imaging (DBI, CI) and IFS data should work properly, but if you find a bug or want to suggest improvements, please ** `**create a ticket** <https://github.com/avigan/VLTPF/issues>`_.

Information
-----------

This repository provides tools for the reduction of VLT/SPHERE data. SPHERE is the planet finder instrument of the Very Large Telescope.

The development of the SPHERE instrument has demanded a tremendous effort from many scientists, who have devoted several years of their life to design, build, test and commission the instrument. To recognize this work, we kindly ask you to cite the relevant instrumental papers in your scientific work. The reference papers for the instrument and its observing mode are:
