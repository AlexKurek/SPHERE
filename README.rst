VLTPF
=====

**Warning**
-----------

**This module is under heavy development at the moment. The only usable part of the code is the filter/neutral density transmission module.**

Information
-----------

This repository provides tools for the reduction of VLT/SPHERE data. SPHERE is the planet finder instrument of the Very Large Telescope.
